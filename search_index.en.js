Power losses and heating design of an DC-AC inverter\nPower losses of an inverter is defined as\n$$\nP_{Loss} = P_{in} - P_{out}\n$$\nWe could measure the losses in two ways.\n\nDirect measure $P_{in}$ and $P_{out}$. The stability of this method is difficult to achieve. A small variant in input or output could lead to a large error.\nIndrect by using Calorimetric methos. Highest accuracy is achieved, but it is complicate to operate.\n\nA alternative of measuring the losses is deriving the losses. The losses can be calculated by estimate of 4 types of power losses.\n\nSwitching losses\nConducting Losses\nBlocking losses (neglecgable)\nDriving losses (neglecable)\n\nThe rule of thumb for a good design is 50% of switching losses and 50% of conducting losses. Let take a closer look at the three-phase inverter.\n\n$$\nP_{conduction} = \\frac{1}{2 \\pi} \\int_{0}^{2 \\pi} v (\\omega t) i (\\omega t) dt\n$$\nPower switch is only conducting for half of period.\n\n$$\n\\text{Note: } V_{CE,0}, ; R_{CE}, ; R_{DS}, ;V_{F,0}, ; R_{F} \\text{ are from the datasheets of Mosfet/IGBT/Diode.}\n$$\nUsing Kirchhoff's current law, we have,\n$$\ni_{IGBT} (\\omega t) + i_{Diode} (\\omega t) = \\hat{i}_N ; sin(\\omega t)\n$$\nwhere:\n\nIn case of Sine-triangle PWM modulation, modulation function $m = M \\cdot sin(\\omega t + \\phi)$ with $M$ is modulation index.\n\nwe have,\n\nReplace equation (1) by equation (3) we get,\n\nFinally, we get the important formular for conduction losses.\n\nSince $R_{DS} \\gg R_{CE}$, we could say that $P_C^{MOS}$ is not smaller than $P_C^{IBGT}$.\nSwitching losses\n$$\n\\begin{align*}\n&amp;  P_{SW,IGBT} = \\frac{1}{\\pi} f_{SW} (E_{on} + E_{off}) \\frac{V_{DC}}{V_{ref}} \\frac{\\hat{i_N}}{i_{ref}} \\\n&amp;  P_{SW,Diode} = \\frac{1}{\\pi} f_{SW} E_{rec} \\frac{V_{DC}}{V_{ref}} \\frac{\\hat{i_N}}{i_{ref}} \\\n&amp;  \\text{ where } E_{rec} = \\frac{1}{2} V_{rr} \\times Q_{rr}\n\\end{align*}\n$$\n4.

Advertise -&gt; Request -&gt; Reply\n\n\nRouter Advertise contains information about Prefix Length and Prefix address\nConfigure ISC DHCPv6 server on Centos\n\nThe prefix-length in the PD message sent by the server depends on the prefix-len that the client sends in the DHCPv6 Solicit message\nIf the client request prefix is different from the one configured on the server, the PD will return Not available\n\n\nConfigure DHCPv6 server running on Cisco IOS\n\nIgnore prefix-length sent by the client --&gt; returns the PD configured on the server.\n\n\nNotice the difference between the two messages: Router Adv (RA) and DHCPv6 Adv (although both are Advertise).\nRapid commit:\n\nAdvertise -&gt; Reply now\nThe DHCPv6 server's Reply message must have a rapid-commit field (the DHCPv6 Jagonet server does not have this field)\n\n\n\nDHCP\n\nDHCP works basically in 4 steps: Discover-Offer-Request-ACK (abbreviated as DORA for easy remembering)\n\nDHCP Discover gives the options that the client wants to get.\nDHCP Offer is based on the options requested by the client and the options it is configured to respond to to the client.\n\n\n\nDHCP uses ARP to determine if that IP address is already in use by a host.\n\nIn the BSD Redhat library, all system calls call the sosend function\nDHCP Server differentiates to grant IP to CPE, CM, eMTA based on\n\noption 60 vendor-class-identifier in DHCP Discover message\ndocsis -&gt;

Conventional current flows from Drain to Source in an N Channel MOSFET.\nN-channel MOSFET\nWhen a channel exists in a MOSFET, current can flow from drain to source&nbsp;or&nbsp;from source to drain - it's a function of how the device is connected in the circuit. The conduction channel has no intrinsic polarity - it's kind of like a resistor in that regard.\nThe intrinsic body diode inside the MOSFET is in parallel with the conduction channel, however. When the conduction channel is present, the diode is shunted and current flows through the path of least resistance (the channel). When the channel is off, the diode is in circuit and will either conduct or block depending on the drain-source current polarity.\nAs your picture shows, there are both N-channel and P-channel devices, as well as enhancement mode and depletion mode devices. In all of these cases, current can flow from source to drain as well as from drain to source - it's just a matter of how the device is connected in the circuit.\nYour picture does&nbsp;not&nbsp;show the intrinsic diode in the devices - the arrow point towards or away from the gate is an indication of the channel type (N-channel points towards the gate, P-channel points away from the gate).\n\nThis symbol shows you the inherent diode between drain and source.\nN-channel enhancement devices need a voltage on the gate&nbsp;higher&nbsp;than the source in order to create a conduction channel. (Enhancement devices don't have a channel automatically, and need gate voltage to create one - because it's N-channel&nbsp;Vgate&gt;Vsource&nbsp;for this to happen.)\nP-channel enhancement devices need a voltage on the gate&nbsp;lower&nbsp;than the source in order to create a conduction channel. (Enhancement devices don't have a channel automatically, and need gate voltage to create one - because it's P-channel&nbsp;Vgate&lt;Vsource&nbsp;for this to happen.)\nN-channel delpetion devices have a channel by default, and need a voltage on the gate&nbsp;lower&nbsp;than the source in order to turn the channel&nbsp;off. The channel can be widened to a certain extent by increasing the gate-to-source voltage above 0.\nP-channel depletion devices also have a channel by default, and need a voltage on the gate&nbsp;higher&nbsp;than the source in order to turn the channel&nbsp;off. The channel can be widened to a certain extent by decreasing the gate-to-source voltage below 0.\nReferences\n1\nChris Terman. 6.004 Computation Structures. Spring 2017.

This means that the destructors do not always deallocate the buffers as in case of Mat. They take into account possible data sharing. A destructor decrements the reference counter associated with the matrix data buffer. The buffer is deallocated if and only if the reference counter reaches zero, that is, when no other structures refer to the same buffer. Similarly, when a Mat instance is copied, no actual data is really copied. Instead, the reference counter is incremented to memorize that there is another owner of the same data. There is also the Mat::clone method that creates a full copy of the matrix data.\n\nLinear vs non-linear filter\nRef\n\nIn cases where the input data contains a large amount of noise but the magnitude is low, a linear low-pass filter may suffice.\nConversely, if an image contains a low amount of noise but with relatively high magnitude, then a median filter may be more appropriate.\nIn either case, the filter process changes the overall frequency content of the image.\n\nBut what is the Fourier Transform?

Assume that each pixel in image has weight that is equal to its intensity. Then the point you defined is centroid (a.k.a. center of mass) of image.\nAssume that I(x,y) is the intensity of pixel (x,y) in image. Then m(i,j) is the sum for all possible x and y of: I(x,y) * (x^i) * (y^j).\nAnd here you can read a wiki article about all kinds of image moments (raw moments, central moments, scale/rotation invariant moments and so on). It is pretty good one and I recommend reading it.\nAdapting this to scalar (greyscale) image with pixel intensities I(x,y), raw image moments Mij are calculated by:\n\nCentroid: ${\\displaystyle {{\\bar {x}},\\ {\\bar {y}}}=\\left{{\\frac {M_{10}}{M_{00}}},{\\frac {M_{01}}{M_{00}}}\\right}}{\\displaystyle {{\\bar {x}},\\ {\\bar {y}}}=\\left{{\\frac {M_{10}}{M_{00}}},{\\frac {M_{01}}{M_{00}}}\\right}}$\nClone all Fiji source code\n# https://forum.image.sc/t/getting-the-source-code-for-fiji-without-using-maven/31964/6\n\nsudo apt install maven\nsudo apt install libxml2-utils\n\ngit clone git://github.com/fiji/fiji\ncd fiji/bin\nwget https://github.com/scijava/scijava-scripts/raw/master/melting-pot.sh\nbin/melt.sh -s\n\nfindContours()\nReference:\n\nmexopencv\ngroup__imgproc__shape\n\nRemember:\n\nIn OpenCV, object to be found should be white and background should be black.\n\nvoid cv::findContours\n    (   InputOutputArray    image,\n        OutputArrayOfArrays contours,\n        OutputArray         hierarchy,\n        int                 mode,\n        int                 method,\n        Point               offset = Point() \n    ) \n\n// Note: absolute value of an area is used because\n// area may be positive or negative - in accordance with the\n// contour orientation\ndouble i = std::fabs(cv::contourArea(cv::Mat(contour1)));\n\nWhat is Contour Approximation Method?\nCHAIN_APPROX_NONE vs CHAIN_APPROX_SIMPLE\n\nWhat is Contours Hierarchy?\n\n\nContour 0,1,2 are the same hierachy level\nchild(2) = 2a; parent(2a) = 2\n\nWatershed algorithm\nEach pixel on the image was categozied as one of three type:\n\n\nregional minimum: the bottom of the cone.\ncatchment basin: the region from the bottom of the cone to watershed line\nwatershed lines: the border of catchment basin\n\nThe algorithm will find these points.\nHow it works\n\nFind regional minimum\nFrom regional minimum, pull the water into catchment basin\nKeeping to pull water into catchment basin until catchment basin overlap.
